## Description

This project is an loose interpretation of an Etch A Sketch game, which is a mechanical drawing toy. For those who are interested or cannot remember, what it looks like, check this [Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch).

In my web form, user is allowed to pick how detailed user wants the grid to be, without changing the overall grid size. 

After deciding, user can draw as the heart desires either using random colors option, or selecting own colors from a color picker. 

After user decides, that user wants to scrap current project, user can 
simply click on the 'reset' button, and the painting will disappear.
